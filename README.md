# deliveroo-clone
This is a small React Native project, in which I created a clone food delivery application (Deliveroo). 
The application is based on React Native as well as Tailwind CSS for styling.
Moreover the data is being imported from Sanity, and it uses Redux for the state.

The initial commit is just a demo version, and it does not include communication between the user and the restaurants, 
delivery information, payments etc.
